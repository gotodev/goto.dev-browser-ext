## Understand code 10x faster on GitHub ðŸ˜‰

This repository consists of a Google Chrome extension which:
* ðŸ’¡ Augments public pages on GitHub.com with helpful tooltips and go-to-definition links
* ðŸ’ª Is uniquely able to understand dependencies even across many different repositories
* âš¡ Works right out of the box: no messing with continuous integration settings!
* ðŸ’— Is open source

Currently only Java is supported. Additional languages will be added if requested.

We take security seriously: This extension never sends out any code from the pages you visit, does not at all work for private repositories and is open source for anyone to review.
